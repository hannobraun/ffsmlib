The functional finite-sate machine library (short: ffsmlib) is a small library for modelling finite-state machines. It is written in Scala (http://scala-lang.org/).

ffsmlib is mainly a toy without any real applicatoins right now. It is probably usable from Java, but the API has a certain "Scala smell" on it, so I don't think this would be a pleasant experience.
